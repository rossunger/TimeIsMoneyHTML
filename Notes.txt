What is time?

*Crippling self doubt*
What am I getting out of this?

“Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.”

"fast, good, cheap. Pick 2"

"A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.""

“Unfortunately, the clock is ticking, the hours are going by. The past increases, the future recedes. Possibilities decreasing, regrets mounting.”

“Here we are, trapped in the amber of the moment. There is no why.”

“Time is an illusion.”

“Time is a created thing. To say 'I don't have time,' is like saying, 'I don't want to.”

“It's being here now that's important. There's no past and there's no future. Time is a very misleading thing. All there is ever, is the now. We can gain experience from the past, but we can't relive it; and we can hope for the future, but we don't know if there is one.”

“Those who make the worst use of their time are the first to complain of its brevity.”

"The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once."

"Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, but today is a gift. That's why it's called the present."

"Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend."

"Time is the longest distance between two places."

"The key is in not spending time, but in investing it."

"We all have our time machines. Some take us back, they're called memories. Some take us forward, they're called dreams."

"Who forces time is pushed back by time; who yields to time finds time on his side."

"Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin."
